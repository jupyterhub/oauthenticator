# OAuth provider specific setup

OAuthenticator provides a generic implementation called `GenericOAuthenticator`
that can be used with **any OAuth2 identity provider**,
but also a few dedicated authentication classes.

Below, there is a list with provider specific setup instructions.

```{warning}
There are other OAuthenticators available in this repository,
but unfortunately currently there are some that don't have their specific setups documented.

[Another example](https://github.com/jupyterhub/dockerspawner/tree/HEAD/examples/oauth)
is using GitHub OAuth to spawn each userâ€™s server in a separate docker
container.
